   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

   EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
   ```

### Deploy to Other Platforms

- **Heroku**: Add `Procfile` with `web: node server.js`
- **Render**: Set build command to `npm install` and start command to `npm start`
- **Vercel**: Add `vercel.json` configuration for serverless deployment

## üîß Configuration

### Email Providers

**Gmail (Recommended)**
```javascript
service: 'gmail',
auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS // App Password
}
```

**Outlook/Hotmail**
```javascript
service: 'hotmail',
auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
}
```

**Custom SMTP**
```javascript
host: 'smtp.yourdomain.com',
port: 587,
secure: false,
auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
}
```

### AI Models

The application uses Groq's `mixtral-8x7b-32768` model by default. You can change this in `server.js`:

```javascript
model: 'llama2-70b-4096', // or other Groq models
temperature: 0.7,
max_tokens: 1000
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Error (Gmail)**
```
Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```
**Solution:** Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password.

**Backend Not Available**
```
Error: Failed to fetch from backend
```
**Solution:** Ensure the backend server is running on port 3001.

**CORS Error**
```
Error: Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy
```
**Solution:** Make sure CORS is properly configured in server.js.

**AI Generation Failed**
```
Error: Groq API error
```
**Solution:** Check your API key and ensure you have available credits.

### Debug Mode

Run the server with debug information:
```bash
DEBUG=* npm start
```
